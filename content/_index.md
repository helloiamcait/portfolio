# Hey there ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a tech-savvy writer with a knack for breaking down complex topics into bite-sized, relatable content. With roots in both the health and tech worlds, I've been busy turning jargon-filled info into content that real people actually want to consume.

## A Bit About Me ðŸ“Œ

After securing my **Bachelor's in Medical Science and Psychology** and **Certificate in Writing** from the University of Western Ontario, I further honed my skills with a **Master's in Journalism** from Ryerson University. From elevating brands at startups like Nellie Health to diving into rigorous research at TULiP Lab, York University, I consistently channel my passion into **impactful writing**.

## Some Highlights ðŸš€

-  **Word Wizardry:** Turning technical talk into fun, understandable content. Whether itâ€™s instructional materials or clinical docs, Iâ€™ve got it covered.
-  **Design Delights:** From wireframes to full-fledged designs, making things look and feel great is my jam.
-  **Web Wonders:** Crafting responsive, user-friendly websites, ensuring that both form and function shine.
-  **Operational Ace:** Crafting tools and strategies that bring real results. Who says efficiency can't be fun?


## Lifelong Learner ðŸ“š

I'm always on the hunt for another opportunity to learn new skills and about emerging technologies. My most recent educational endeavor was an online **API Documentation course** from [Iâ€™d Rather Be Writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/).
