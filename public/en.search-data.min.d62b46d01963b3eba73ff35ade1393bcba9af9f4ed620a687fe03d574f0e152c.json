For screen display: optimal graphics display resolution is 100 ppi. If the resolution is below the optimal ppi, then you need to increase the resolution of the graphic from its source file. Repeat this process for all pixelated graphics. Note: The process for optimizing the resolution of graphics differs from project-to-project. However, most graphics editing software will give you the option to change the resolution when exporting.\nStep 2: Relink to high-resolution graphic # In InDesign, click on a pixelated graphic.
