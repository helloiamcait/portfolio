Click on the pixelated image in the InDesign file. Open the Links panel by typing Shift+Command+D (for MacOs) or Shift+Control+D (for Windows). Identify the method to follow based on the number of image files that are in SVG format: If some or none of the images in the Links panel end in .svg, follow the Method 1: Relink high-quality images instructions. If all of the images in the Links panel end in .svg, follow the Method 2: Adjust Performance Display settings instructions. Method 1: Relink to high quality images # If some or none of the images in the Links panel end in .svg, then they are linked to the wrong image files. The PNG and JPEG image files used in this project are not high enough resolution to use in the handouts. You need to relink the images to their SVG versions before exporting the document as a PDF again.\nMacOS In the Links panel, select an image that does not end in .svg. Control-click the image name and select Reveal in Finder. In Finder, press Command+3 to view as Columns. In the right column, scroll down and take note of the Dimensions and Resolution. Look in the folder for other versions of the image. If there is a version that ends in .svg, then skip to Step 7. Otherwise, repeat Step 4 for each version of the image that you find. Note: Different versions of the same image should have the same name, but with different suffixes. For example, leaf-1.png, leaf-2.png, leaf-3.jpg are different versions of the same image. Identify the version of the image with the highest resolution and the largest dimensions. Navigate back to InDesign and reopen the Links panel. Control-click on the highlighted image, click Relink, select the name of the version that ends in .svg or that you identified in Step 6, and press Open. Repeat steps 1–7 for each image that looks pixelated in the exported PDF. Windows In the Links panel, select an image that does not end in .svg. Right-click the image name and select Reveal in Explorer. In Explorer, press Alt+Enter to open the properties window. Take note of the Dimensions and Resolution.

Repeat steps 1–7 for each image that looks pixelated in the exported PDF. Method 2: Adjust Performance Display settings # If all of the images in the Links panel end in .svg, then the Performance Display settings are not set properly. You need to adjust the Performance Display settings before exporting the document as a PDF again.\nIn the menu bar, select InDesign \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Display Performance Adjust the settings to match the following: Default View: High Quality Preserve Object-Level Display Settings is unchecked Adjust View Settings: High Quality Raster Images: High Resolution Vector Graphics: High Resolution Transparency: High Quality Enable Anti-aliasing is checked Greek Type Below: 7 pt Click OK.
