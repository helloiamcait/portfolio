There are two possible solutions depending on how the images look in the InDesign file:\nIf images look pixelated in InDesign, then Image resolution is too low If images do not look pixelated in InDesign, then Performance Display settings are not optimized Problem 1: Images resolution is too low # If the images exported from InDesign also look pixelated in the InDesign file, then the resolution of the images is too low. Follow these steps to check image resolution and replace low-resolution images:\nIn InDesign, click on a pixelated image and choose Window\u0026gt;Info to open the Info panel. The Effective ppi in the Info Panel is the image resolution within the document, and it should match one of the following: For print optimal image resolution is 300 ppi. For screen display optimal image resolution is 100 ppi. If the image resolution is below the optimal ppi, then you need to increase the image resolution from the image source file. Note: The process for optimizing image resolution differs from project-to-project. However, most graphics editing software will give you the option to change this variable in the export window. In InDesign, relink the pixelated image to the new high-resolution image. Adobe describes how to do this in the Replace a link with a different source file section of Adobe\u0026rsquo;s Linked and embedded graphics help page. Problem 2: Performance Display settings are not optimized # If the images exported from InDesign are not pixelated in the InDesign file, then you need to adjust the Performance Display settings by following these steps:\nNavigate to InDesign \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Display Performance Adjust the settings to match the following: Default View: High Quality Preserve Object-Level Display Settings is unchecked Adjust View Settings: High Quality Raster Images: High Resolution Vector Graphics: High Resolution Transparency: High Quality Enable Anti-aliasing is checked Greek Type Below: 7 pt Click OK.
